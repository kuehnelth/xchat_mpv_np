Usage:
======

`/mpv` - Show information about currently open file in mpv

Setup:
======

`xchat_mpv_np.py` uses the mpv [JSON IPC Protocol](http://mpv.io/manual/stable/#json-ipc).
To enable it, add the following line to `~/.mpv/config`
    input-unix-socket=~/.mpv/socket

`xchat_mpv_np_windows.py` works without any setup.
